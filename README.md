# Bitcoin_Price_Prediction_Using_Linear-Regression
## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the price of Bitcoin using a linear regression model. By analyzing historical data, we aim to forecast future Bitcoin prices, providing valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts.

## Project Description
## Objectives
Develop a linear regression model to predict Bitcoin prices based on historical data.
Analyze the relationship between various features (e.g., time, market trends) and Bitcoin prices.
Provide an easy-to-use script for training and predicting Bitcoin prices.
## Dataset
Source: Historical Bitcoin price data obtained from a reliable financial dataset provider (e.g., CoinGecko, Yahoo Finance).
Features: The dataset includes time-series data such as date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, volume, and market cap.
## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Load and clean the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Feature engineering to create relevant predictors for the model.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Visualize data to understand trends and correlations.
6. Generate summary statistics to gain insights into the data distribution.
## **Linear Regression Model**
1.Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Train a linear regression model using the training set.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
4. Prediction and Analysis
Use the trained model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
Analyze the model's predictions and interpret the results.
